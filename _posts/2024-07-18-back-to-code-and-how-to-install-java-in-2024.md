# Back to code - And how to install Java in 2024

I haven't been coding full time in the last three years. Working as Tech Manager, basicaly my coding activities were less than 10% of my working time, and considering I have my tech setup installed when I joined Mercado Livre, I haven't updated it very often.

But now I am backing to code and I have some java projects to work with. Coming back do java since three years ago, made me feel like a beginner, looking for guides on internet on how to configure my java setup.

For my surprise, it hasn't changed a lot and my memory was also able to remember a few good commands to install java, maven and gradle. To install it, basicaly I need to install [sdk.io]([https://sdkman.io/)
```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```


After install [sdk.io]([https://sdkman.io/), I just trusted in their guide to install java, maven and gradle, and it really worked fine:

```shell
sdk install java
sdk install maven
sdk install gradle
```

That is it! I am happy to use Java again :)
