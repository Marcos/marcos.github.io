<p>Hey, my name is Marcos and I am a software engineer and passionated about people and cultures, what allowed me to work in projects in many countries, like Brazil, Germany, USA, Ireland, Spain and Argentina, enabling me to speak fluently English, Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>I have been working since 2003 with a lot of stuffs, but mostly Java, Kotlin and Golang.</p> 

<p>I am a big fan of surfing and programming and you may find here some of my texts about anything, both in portugues or english.</p>

<p>If you want to keep in touch, send me an <a href="mailto:marcos.wp@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a shout in one of my social media.</p>
